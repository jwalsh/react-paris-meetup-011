** Overview
Evolution of headless UI libraries and emerging challenges in the ecosystem.

** Key Topics
- Historical context: scarcity of headless UI libraries
- Current explosion: Radix, Headless UI, Ark UI, etc.
- Technical decisions behind these libraries
- Selection criteria for projects
- New challenges and trade-offs

** Headless UI Library Comparison

timeline
    title Evolution of Headless UI Libraries
    2018 : Few options
         : Styled components dominate
    2020 : Headless UI emerges
         : Radix UI launches
    2022 : Ecosystem explosion
         : Ark UI, React Aria
    2024 : Maturity & consolidation
         : New challenges appear
