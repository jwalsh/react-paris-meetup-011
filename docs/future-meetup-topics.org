* Overview

Potential topics for React Paris Meetups #012 and #013, building on themes
from meetup #011 (Concurrency and UI Libraries Evolution).

* Meetup #012 - Potential Topics

** Option A: React Server Components Deep Dive

*** Talk 1: RSC Architecture and Mental Models
- How RSC differs from SSR/SSG
- Server vs Client component boundaries
- Data fetching patterns with RSC
- Streaming and progressive rendering
- When to use "use client" vs keeping server-only

*** Talk 2: Building a Full-Stack App with RSC
- Next.js App Router patterns
- Server Actions for mutations
- Caching strategies
- Error handling and loading states
- Performance optimization

*** Why This Topic?
- Follows naturally from React 19 concurrency discussion
- RSC is the biggest architectural shift since hooks
- Many developers still confused about when/how to use RSC

** Option B: State Management in 2025

*** Talk 1: The Death of Redux? State Management Evolution
- Redux Toolkit vs alternatives
- Zustand, Jotai, Valtio comparison
- React Query/TanStack Query for server state
- When you still need Redux
- Signals (Preact, SolidJS influence on React)

*** Talk 2: Building Without Global State
- URL as state (nuqs, next-usequerystate)
- Server state vs client state
- Form state with React 19 Actions
- Local-first architectures
- Optimistic updates patterns

*** Why This Topic?
- re-frame discussion opened questions about state management
- Many teams still over-using global state
- React 19 Actions change the game for form state

** Option C: Testing Modern React Applications

*** Talk 1: Testing Strategies for Concurrent React
- Testing useTransition and Suspense
- React Testing Library best practices
- Mocking server components
- Snapshot testing: still useful?
- Component vs integration vs E2E balance

*** Talk 2: Visual Regression and Accessibility Testing
- Storybook and Chromatic
- Playwright component testing
- Automated accessibility testing
- Testing headless UI components
- CI/CD integration patterns

*** Why This Topic?
- Testing concurrent features is tricky
- Headless UI libraries need different testing approaches
- Many teams struggle with testing strategy

* Meetup #013 - Potential Topics

** Option A: Performance Optimization Masterclass

*** Talk 1: Profiling and Optimizing React Apps
- React DevTools Profiler deep dive
- Identifying unnecessary re-renders
- useMemo/useCallback: when actually useful
- Code splitting strategies
- Bundle analysis and optimization

*** Talk 2: Core Web Vitals and React
- LCP, FID, CLS optimization
- Image optimization strategies
- Font loading best practices
- Third-party script management
- Measuring real user performance

*** Why This Topic?
- Concurrent rendering is about perceived performance
- Many teams don't know how to profile effectively
- Core Web Vitals affect SEO

** Option B: Design Systems and Component Libraries

*** Talk 1: Building a Design System from Scratch
- Token-based design (Style Dictionary)
- Component API design principles
- Compound components pattern
- Accessibility by default
- Documentation with Storybook

*** Talk 2: Migrating to/from UI Libraries
- When to build vs buy
- Migration strategies (MUI to Radix, etc.)
- Handling breaking changes
- Design token standardization
- Component versioning

*** Why This Topic?
- Directly follows Talk 2 from meetup #011
- Radix maintenance concerns make this urgent
- Many teams evaluating options

** Option C: AI and React Development

*** Talk 1: AI-Assisted React Development
- GitHub Copilot patterns
- v0.dev and AI component generation
- AI for accessibility testing
- Prompt engineering for React code
- Limitations and best practices

*** Talk 2: Building AI Features in React Apps
- Streaming responses with Suspense
- Vercel AI SDK
- Chat interfaces patterns
- Rate limiting and error handling
- Cost optimization strategies

*** Why This Topic?
- AI is transforming development workflow
- Many React apps now include AI features
- Need to discuss responsible AI integration

* ClojureScript-Focused Topics (Special Edition)

** Reagent/re-frame in 2025: What Now?

*** Talk 1: The State of ClojureScript React Wrappers
- Reagent's React 19 incompatibility
- UIx2 as the modern alternative
- Helix patterns
- Migration strategies

*** Talk 2: re-frame Patterns for Complex SPAs
- Event-driven architecture
- Effect isolation
- Subscription optimization
- Debugging with re-frame-10x

** core.async for UI Development

*** Talk 1: CSP Patterns for React Developers
- Channels and go blocks explained
- Debounce/throttle with core.async
- Coordinating async operations
- Comparison with React hooks

*** Talk 2: Building Reactive UIs with core.async
- Event stream processing
- State machines with channels
- Testing async code
- Performance considerations
