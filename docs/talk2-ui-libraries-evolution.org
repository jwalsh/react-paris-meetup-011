** Abstract

The evolution of "headless" UI libraries that offer components without styling.
Today there has been an explosion of solutions like Radix, Headless UI, Ark UI,
etc. This presentation discusses:

- The evolution of UI libraries
- Technical choices behind these libraries
- How to select the right one based on your needs
- New problems they pose

* The Evolution of React UI Libraries

** Generation 1: Styled Component Libraries (2015-2018)

*** Examples
- Bootstrap (React Bootstrap)
- Material-UI (MUI)
- Ant Design
- Semantic UI React

*** Characteristics
- Complete design systems as importable components
- Opinionated styling built-in
- Quick to get started
- Consistent look and feel

*** Problems Introduced
- Bundle size bloat (importing entire design system)
- Difficult to customize beyond theme variables
- "Every app looks the same" syndrome
- Fighting against the library's opinions
- Tight coupling between logic and styles

** Generation 2: Utility-First CSS (2017-2020)

*** Examples
- Tailwind CSS
- Tachyons
- Styled System

*** Characteristics
- Atomic CSS classes
- No pre-built components
- Full styling control
- Smaller bundles (purging unused classes)

*** Problems
- Verbose class names
- Learning curve for utility classes
- No component logic provided
- Accessibility not addressed

** Generation 3: Headless/Unstyled Libraries (2020-2023)

*** Examples
- Radix UI
- Headless UI (Tailwind Labs)
- React Aria (Adobe)
- Reach UI
- Downshift

*** Characteristics
- Logic and accessibility without styling
- Fully composable primitives
- ARIA patterns built-in
- Keyboard navigation included
- Focus management handled

*** The Headless Philosophy

#+BEGIN_SRC text
TRADITIONAL LIBRARY:
+----------------------------------+
|  Component = Logic + Style       |
|  (tightly coupled)               |
+----------------------------------+

HEADLESS LIBRARY:
+------------------+  +------------------+
|  Logic Layer     |  |  Style Layer     |
|  (accessibility, |  |  (your CSS,      |
|   state, events) |  |   Tailwind, etc) |
+------------------+  +------------------+
         |                    |
         +--------+-----------+
                  |
                  v
         +------------------+
         |  Your Component  |
         +------------------+
#+END_SRC

** Generation 4: Copy-Paste Architecture (2023-Present)

*** Examples
- shadcn/ui
- Catalyst (Tailwind)
- Tremor

*** Characteristics
- Not a package - copy source code into your project
- Full ownership of components
- Built on headless primitives (Radix)
- Tailwind for styling
- CLI for adding components

*** The shadcn/ui Model

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# Instead of: npm install @some-ui/button
# You run:
npx shadcn-ui@latest add button

# This copies the component SOURCE into your project:
# components/ui/button.tsx
#+END_SRC

*** Advantages
- No dependency lock-in
- Full customization control
- Understand what you're shipping
- Easy to modify internals

*** New Problems
- Consistency across large teams
- No automatic updates
- Duplicated code across projects
- Requires understanding internals

* Current Landscape (2025)

** Popularity Metrics

| Library | GitHub Stars | Weekly Downloads | Notes |
|---------+--------------+------------------+-------|
| MUI | 95k+ | 3.3M | Still most adopted |
| Ant Design | 93k+ | 1.3M | Popular in Asia |
| shadcn/ui | 83k+ | 200k+ | Fastest growing |
| Chakra UI | 38k+ | 587k+ | Good DX |
| Radix UI | 17k+ | 130k+ | Foundation for shadcn |
| Mantine | 27k+ | 300k+ | Full-featured |

** The Radix Situation

*** Critical Development (Late 2024)

The Radix team has shifted focus to *Base UI*, a new project in collaboration
with MUI. This raises questions about Radix's long-term maintenance.

*** Impact on Ecosystem

#+BEGIN_SRC text
DEPENDENCY CHAIN:
shadcn/ui --> Radix UI --> ??? (uncertain future)
#+END_SRC

Projects built on Radix (including shadcn/ui) may face:
- Future compatibility issues
- Need for migration to alternatives
- Uncertain bug fix timeline

*** Alternatives

- *React Aria* (Adobe): Enterprise backing, active development, most robust
- *Headless UI* (Tailwind Labs): Maintained by Tailwind team
- *Ark UI*: From Chakra UI creators, newer option
- *Base UI*: The new Radix successor (MUI collaboration)

* Future Problematiques (Challenges)

** 1. Maintenance and Sustainability

*** The Problem
Open source UI libraries require significant ongoing effort:
- Browser compatibility updates
- React version compatibility
- Accessibility standard changes
- Security patches

*** Questions to Consider
- Who maintains this library?
- What's their funding model?
- What happens if maintainers leave?
- Is there corporate backing?

** 2. React Server Components Compatibility

*** The Challenge
RSC changes how components can be written:
- "use client" directive requirements
- Serialization constraints
- Hydration considerations

*** Library Responses
| Library | RSC Support | Notes |
|---------+-------------+-------|
| MUI | Partial | Working on it |
| shadcn/ui | Good | Client components explicit |
| Radix | Partial | Some primitives work |
| React Aria | Good | Designed for flexibility |

** 3. The "Everything Looks Like shadcn" Problem

*** The Aesthetic Convergence
So many projects use shadcn/ui's default styling that web applications
are starting to look identical.

*** Solutions
- Heavy customization investment
- Custom design tokens
- Alternative base components
- Unique animation/interaction patterns

** 4. Design-Development Sync

*** The Gap
- Figma designs vs actual components
- Design tokens synchronization
- Component API mismatches

*** Emerging Solutions
- Figma plugins for code generation
- Design token standards (Style Dictionary)
- Component documentation (Storybook)

** 5. Bundle Size and Performance

*** The Trade-offs

#+BEGIN_SRC text
MORE FEATURES          <---->  SMALLER BUNDLE
Full component library          Headless primitives
Rich animations                 CSS-only transitions
All-in-one solution             Multiple small packages
#+END_SRC

*** Optimization Strategies
- Tree shaking
- Code splitting
- Dynamic imports
- Server components for static parts

** 6. Accessibility Debt

*** The Hidden Cost
Many teams:
- Skip accessibility initially
- Plan to "add it later"
- Underestimate complexity

*** Why Headless Libraries Help
- ARIA patterns built-in
- Keyboard navigation handled
- Focus management included
- Screen reader tested

** 7. Choosing the Right Library

*** Decision Framework

* Recommendations for 2025

** For New Projects

1. *Evaluate RSC compatibility* - Will you use Server Components?
2. *Consider maintenance* - Who backs this library?
3. *Check accessibility* - Is it built-in or bolted-on?
4. *Assess customization needs* - How unique is your design?

** For Existing Projects

1. *Audit current dependencies* - Are they actively maintained?
2. *Plan migration path* - Especially if using Radix
3. *Document deviations* - Track custom modifications
4. *Monitor ecosystem* - Stay informed about library futures

** Technology Choices by Use Case

| Use Case | Recommended Approach |
|----------+----------------------|
| Startup MVP | shadcn/ui or Chakra UI |
| Enterprise app | React Aria + design system |
| Design-heavy product | Headless + custom CSS |
| Internal tools | MUI or Ant Design |
| High-performance | Headless + minimal CSS |
